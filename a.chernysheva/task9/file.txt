A delivery robot is needed to deliver goods or ready meals to people. 
According to the available statistical data, accidents with the delivery robot occurs due to the collision of the robot with the environment.
For example with passing car or person.
Machinery designers identified hazards, so the maximum speed of the robot is 8 km per hour. It is quite possible to avoid a collision with it.
But there is always a residual risk, for this reason we have cases of a robot colliding with a car at the pedestrian crossing, but no one injured there.
Engineers have taken preventive measures and now the robot has appropriate sensors capable of detecting objects and their speed at a distance of 150 meters.
Thanks to this and other components, the robot can estimate the surrounding situation for motion planning. 
I think in the future, with improved technology, robots can replace human couriers. It has high social costs because many people may lose their jobs.
